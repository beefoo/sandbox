Engineer notes (Brad) for RXF 8233:

Technical notes:
Full track mono tape with splices on 7" reel.
Tape recorded at 7 1/2 ips.
Tape was azimuth adjusted on an Otari MTR-12 in cal in A1.8 with signal routed through Maselec MTC-2 master control with +6 dB of gain to Prism ADA-8XR analog to digital converters to Pyramix DAW version 7.0.11 SP3 Build 12120 21.04.2011.
Levels vary, but are generally low.
This reel has lots of splices (many of which required repair) and several tape types.

Content notes:
Varieties of street and construction sounds.
