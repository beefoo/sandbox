[Can audio engineer provide more information on recorded contents? Could this be from a commercially released recording?]

Engineer Notes:

The tape was recorded from a disc, perhaps a commercial release. The performances are similar or may be the same as found on the CD New Forms in Jazz: Complete Capitol Recordings 1954-1955 which was released in 2006.
The last three segments are the song a ring-tailed monkey repeated.
The times within the brackets is the start marker for each segment. ps
