"Few adults hear children asking Santa for Christmas gifts.  We hear children speaking to Santa who asks if children want dolls or balloons.  A little boy lists the many things that he wants.  Tony interviews a Santa in the street (the bell ringing type).  This Santa likes the kids and is paid well enough.  In the summer many of his peers sell ice cream.  The Bloomingdale's Santa reveals that he is an actor"--From collection documentation.
