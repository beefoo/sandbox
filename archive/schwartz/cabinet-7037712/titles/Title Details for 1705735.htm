    Conversation about National Victim Center; Conversation about toxicity

Summary

Side A:
First: Interview with woman from National Crime Victim's Hotline about the negative reaction victims sometimes have to their name -- want to be known as crime victims, not just victims.  Parts are taped over.  May be material for a commercial.  Second: Unidentified man talks with Tony Schwartz about toxicity -- appears to be talking about children's drinks, but the audio is somewhat indistinct.  Third: inaudible conversation/speech.

Side B:
Continuation of inaudible conversation/speech.
