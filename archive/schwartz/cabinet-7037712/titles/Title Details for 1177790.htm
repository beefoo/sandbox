Notes found in MAVIS when I opened it:
This episode of Wednesday review, a cultural review program on channel 13, New York City, focuses on on Marshall McLuhan and his book, Understanding Media. Guests Harold Rosenberg, Tom Wolfe, and Richard Schickel discuss issues raised by McLuhan: the inundation of information due to the media; media as an extension of the senses; Gutenberg and the print society; a shift from the oral to the visual; reintegration of the senses; the importance of medium to message in poetry, TV, etc.; and McLuhan's notion of "hot" vs. "cool" media.
