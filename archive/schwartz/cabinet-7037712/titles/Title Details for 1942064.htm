    Comments by Jeanette Prussak and Rod Oshey, 1971-09-27

Stereo, Jeanette + Rod Oshey

Summary

Rod Oshey comments on how teachers present themselves: doctors practice medicine, lawyers practice law, but teachers teach, they do not practice teaching. Jeanette [Prussak?] comments on her experience at the airport picking up her mother, who came in on El Al Airlines, through customs: the flight was delayed and customs was long, rude, and in violation of personal property.

Note
Cataloged from container and accompanying collection documentation.

Unclear whether the tape was recorded in stereo or if "stereo" is the first word in the title.

Woman speaking on tape is identified in collection documentation both as Jeanette Prussak and Jeanette Oshey. She was Tony Schwartz's longtime secretary.

{Audio engineer: Please verify that sound is stereo.]
