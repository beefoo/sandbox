Content note:
"The automobile show is at the Coliseum. Listen to the difference between a horn from the current era and a horn from a 1916 Stuts Bulldog. The horn was used to warn pedestrians and road hogs. The first cars, in the 1890's, used 'Bermuda' bells. We hear an 1898 Dellahay with a bulb horn, a 1901 Columbia Gas runabout with a bell, a 1903 Pierce Motorette with another tone of bell. We also hear a 1906 Success Autobuggy, a 1906 Mercedes Roadster, a 1911 Stanley Steamer, a 1911 Maxwell Roadster, a 1912 Moon Raceabout, a 1914 Regal Coup, a fire engine, and a test-a-phone"--Accompanying collection documentation.
