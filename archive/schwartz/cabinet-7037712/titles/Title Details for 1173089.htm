    Folk singers and folks

Summary

RXF 3611:
Folk singers and folks (Tony Schwartz, narrator ; Burl Ives, vocal and guitar ; George Edwards, vocal) (0:00).

"With the rise in the popularity of folk concerts, we may ask what a folk singer is and how he differs from a singer of folk songs.  Burl Ives, a singer of folk songs, does a studio cut for commercial sale.  George Edwards, on his back porch, sings the same song because he likes it, and grew up with it.  He is a folk singer"--From collection documentation.
