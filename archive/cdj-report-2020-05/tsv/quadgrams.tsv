how to use a	2
know if it is	2
a little difficult to	2
instead of having to	2
forward to following the	2
all your hard work	2
able to combine samples	2
around with it more	2
i really enjoyed the	2
needs to be more	2

be able to choose	2
the bb king interview	2
very excited for the	2
makes it hard to	2
will try again on	2
in the explore section	2
to create their own	2
but it could be	2
the remix feature is	2

so much for creating	2
how easy it is	2
tiny snippets of a	2
i want to use	2
this is an extremely	2
the buttons at the	2
to have more control	2

the ui could use	2
multiple samples into the	2
way for users to	2
use more than one	2

love to see a	2
one of the samples	2
and i am looking	2
if you could use	2

little difficult to navigate	2
impossible to find something	2

i need to explore	2
at the top of	2
lot of potential and	2
able to see the	2
adjust the size of	2
it is possible to	2
incredible idea and i	2
i think that the	2
for it to play	2
like to share about	2
it is very cool	2
a way to build	2
be great if it	2
get to the full	2
the drum machine sequencer	2
not intuitive at all	2
would be very helpful	2
i would also like	2
using it in my	2
could use some work	2
had to open the	2
not find a search	2
as a way to	2
no idea what the	2
a dj and a	2
in a long time	2
need to spend more	2
buttons at the bottom	2
at the same time	2
player at the bottom	2
the rest of the	2
be fun to have	2
easy to navigate and	2
a big fan of	2
it was hard to	2
i was able to	2
is a bit clunky	2
about your experience with	2
the context of a	2
bottom of the screen	2
the colors in the	2
the more information tab	2
to understand how the	2
difficult to navigate and	2
with a lot of	2
it is easy to	2
have a search feature	2
a way to sort	2
to the full source	2
more than one sound	2
is a little confusing	2
cool to be able	2
as a big fan	2
reminds me of the	2
be able to select	2
option to download the	2
inspire a lot of	2
is an amazing tool	2
and put them into	2
and if you could	2
be downloaded as wavs	2
i went back to	2
the free music archive	2
i would use the	2
search function would be	2
not be able to	2
dragging to explore the	2
multiple sources in the	2
if there is a	2
for the future of	2
on the explore page	2
for all your hard	2
is a wonderful idea	2
really looking forward to	2
as soon as i	2
thank you for doing	2
there should be an	2
be nice to make	2
sure if i could	2
with the remix tool	2
had a lot of	2
more than one sample	2
a great source for	2
to adjust the size	2
a lot of potential	2
and i hope it	2
would be fun to	2
easy it is to	2
found myself wanting to	2
samples as opposed to	2
have access to this	2
out how to save	2
samples into the sequencer	2
should be able to	2
to change the sample	2
of what you can	2
you for all your	2
thank you for all	2

music that i can	2
be cool to be	2
a lot of effort	2
