input-file		input-file			.ukn	text/plain	29969	2402	79	A few things I especially liked: the high-level find-a-sample-in-the-pile screen (great way to handle having a lot of material without any particular idea of what you're seeking or what's in there) the drum sample + beat-pattern selector (this goes kinda above & beyond what I was expecting) the per-sample tool to tweak the duration & volume (I would love a way to tweak the start-offset too) A few things I was hoping to see that I didn't find: a way to "remix" using samples from multiple sources a way to build collections/folders of samples from various sources (ideally so I can just batch-download (& get the source credits), but really just any way to easily find a sample I liked again would be great) a few illustrative samples/previews of maybe what to expect per "library"(?) on the first screen a quick overview of what's what, and what the flow looks like And as an aside, I got a bit annoyed by the samples I'd found / remixed getting lost between tasks.	./cache/input-file.ukn	./txt/input-file.txt
