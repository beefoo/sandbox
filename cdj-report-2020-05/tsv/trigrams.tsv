the drum machine	5
the length of	5
to play with	5
the site was	5
to listen to	5
sure if i	5
but i think	5
great to have	5
able to use	5
great way to	5

it would also	5
get to the	5
i have a	5
was a little	5
to search for	5
you want to	5
have access to	5
the record button	5
it was not	5
an incredible resource	5
very difficult to	5
i think the	5
bb king interview	5
this is just	5
of the sample	5
is a way	5
the user interface	5
and i hope	5
i really enjoyed	5
hard to use	5
on the website	5
the interface is	5
love this idea	5
it easy to	5
it was a	5
is it possible	5
i wanted to	5
to use it	5
more than one	5
the explore tab	5
it possible to	5
is a very	5
forward to exploring	5
of the website	5
seem to work	5
easy to navigate	5
to the loc	5
difficult to navigate	5
i think there	5
the step sequencer	5
all of the	5
a great project	5
on my iphone	5
samples from different	5
want to use	5
samples into the	4
what you can	4
in a daw	4
be great if	4
a great way	4
to do that	4
a variety of	4
to see a	4
i got a	4
to explore the	4
and easy to	4
excited to see	4
to have more	4
but it would	4
needs to be	4
the beat maker	4
is super cool	4
a really cool	4
be a great	4
to get the	4
be a way	4
this project and	4
an amazing project	4
a link to	4
love love love	4
a great tool	4
it easier to	4
to the remix	4
the website is	4
all the samples	4
also be nice	4
excited for the	4
i think i	4
to make the	4
where you can	4
what i was	4
make it easier	4
this will be	4
and this is	4
more user friendly	4
listen to the	4
could be a	4
not sure if	4
would be helpful	4
from the same	4
use samples from	4
for a while	4
able to combine	4
would have been	4
the play in	4
it is possible	4
the site and	4
to explore and	4
i will continue	4
the play button	4
there should be	4
very excited to	4
an easy way	4
on the site	4
and a great	4
thanks for making	4
is very difficult	4
i would be	4
could use some	4
you for putting	4
spend more time	4
this is super	4
for a long	4
the drum machines	4
an option to	4
to use a	4
to play the	4
you for the	4
that would be	4
to use samples	4
simple to use	4
if it is	4
i feel like	4
a search bar	4
to play around	4
if you want	4
if there were	4
it difficult to	4
a bit more	4
with a beat	4
a lot more	4
should have a	4
at the top	4
as opposed to	4
way to explore	4
it is very	4
to me how	4
from different sources	4
if i can	4
to find the	4
is so cool	4
at a time	4
about how to	4
will be a	4
this is very	4
samples from multiple	4
difficult to find	4
very cool and	4
on how to	4
i could not	4
i am very	4
for putting this	4
for it to	4
to browse the	4
i like the	4
a bit of	4
the way the	4
the browse view	4
to get to	4
some of the	4
would make it	4
the sounds in	4
your hard work	4
have to be	4
what an amazing	4
i wonder if	4
figure out what	4
because i have	4
work on this	3
so this is	3
to use this	3
on my laptop	3
was fun and	3
for years and	3
how to do	3
the option to	3
issue for me	3
the audio file	3
a very good	3
put in a	3
i really love	3
i hope it	3
to navigate the	3
the coolest things	3
feature would be	3
for doing this	3
am looking forward	3
the beat making	3
for finding samples	3
to use as	3
other than that	3
able to select	3
instead of having	3
could not find	3
think there should	3
hard to do	3
i would recommend	3
in context button	3
a way for	3
could be more	3
a bit overwhelming	3
in the explore	3
size of the	3
using it in	3
the sample in	3
and it was	3
sounds from multiple	3
like it is	3
way to download	3
sample packs and	3
play around with	3
the samples that	3
know how to	3
for your work	3
definitely use this	3
was a way	3
really like the	3
sounds that i	3
that was fun	3
drag the mouse	3
i am looking	3
seems like a	3
in addition to	3
find a search	3
would have liked	3
me of the	3
i can just	3
of the page	3
for me to	3
with citizen dj	3
to spend more	3
of the clips	3
would be fun	3
i did find	3
i know that	3
scrub through the	3
the remix section	3
working on this	3
is one of	3
have a search	3
of what you	3
is an awesome	3
as a way	3
of sounds that	3
that can be	3
on mobile safari	3
understand how the	3
i would also	3
love the concept	3
that you can	3
on my phone	3
is kind of	3
to tweak the	3
love the idea	3
the samples themselves	3
you for sharing	3
way to do	3
it could be	3
multiple sources in	3
of the sounds	3
was unable to	3
to have the	3
next to the	3
this is excellent	3
it can be	3
a search feature	3
only thing i	3
love to have	3
think this site	3
with the beat	3
to be more	3
as a music	3
of a sound	3
an easier way	3
very cool idea	3
was very difficult	3
putting this together	3
i appreciate the	3
that you could	3
have liked to	3
have to scroll	3
figure it out	3
the only thing	3
for making it	3
it feels like	3
a great source	3
on the page	3
be fun to	3
are too short	3
go back and	3
of the screen	3
i could only	3
really enjoyed using	3
the concept is	3
great to be	3
forward to using	3
was the most	3
very cool project	3
way to go	3
have a way	3
rather than just	3
in the sound	3
it should be	3
am very excited	3
types of sounds	3
to make this	3
and would love	3
sounds in the	3
for this amazing	3
go back to	3
a way that	3
the loc website	3
have no doubt	3
be an issue	3
length of the	3
but that was	3
to have access	3
a sample is	3
a music producer	3
and i feel	3
is not very	3
the sound browser	3
the size of	3
search function to	3
use the sounds	3
i like it	3
i hope this	3
me how to	3
in my own	3
the sounds and	3
the user experience	3
has a lot	3
be an option	3
create a beat	3
change the sample	3
that i can	3
how to add	3
it is easy	3
as far as	3
the history of	3
wait for it	3
wait to see	3
i went back	3
to go back	3
to learn how	3
the samples were	3
to work with	3
would be very	3
lot of fun	3
an incredible tool	3
that i only	3
would have to	3
the citizen dj	3
use in music	3
really cool project	3
able to choose	3
on the first	3
library of sounds	3
was hard to	3
the remix tab	3
option to download	3
around for a	3
not sure what	3
for users to	3
a bit clunky	3
to see what	3
think it would	3
i think my	3
possible to combine	3
no no no	3
to record the	3
how i can	3
will be back	3
this is one	3
was a bit	3
back to the	3
lot of people	3
to everyone involved	3
samples in the	3
see a way	3
is a fantastic	3
at some point	3
fun to have	3
nice if you	3
what you have	3
and thank you	3
you for creating	3
of sounds and	3
seems to be	3
an amazing tool	3
and make it	3
of the interface	3
to change the	3
me to get	3
i can select	3
i tried to	3
a year old	3
like the remix	3
clips are too	3
the full recording	3
wish i could	3
hold down the	3
drums and the	3
easy to find	3
i have to	3
sources in the	3
use in a	3
was easy to	3
interface where you	3
i was unable	3
would be useful	3
it a little	3
the original recording	3
project and i	3
best of luck	3
the bb king	3
i do think	3
seemed to be	3
for all your	3
it to be	3
to make it	3
to this site	3
it would help	3
not what i	3
confused about how	3
it in my	3
a search tool	3
what to do	3
a little confusing	3
to do with	3
that i could	3
little bit more	3
in a way	3
it is also	3
will definitely use	3
where i can	3
and i will	3
it was easy	3
easier way to	3
i am not	3
but i can	3
is a wonderful	3
is an excellent	3
like to know	3
buttons at the	3
of this project	3
too short to	3
i hope that	3
be interested in	3
of the coolest	3
click and hold	3
a few things	3
thank you library	2
easy it is	2
and be able	2
it was fun	2
samples that i	2
to adjust the	2
absolutely love this	2
all of this	2
most producers would	2
to give me	2
them to the	2
redacted i wonder	2
point of the	2
possible for me	2
as i browse	2
and i just	2
found it difficult	2
as a whole	2
keep it up	2
be a cool	2
the audio snippet	2
of the library	2
is also very	2
cool but the	2
to do and	2
were possible to	2
it were possible	2
scroll through and	2
drum machine sequencer	2
you can reach	2
you could use	2
the screen where	2
with this project	2
the sample library	2
be useful to	2
rest of the	2
how easy it	2
than one sound	2
an amazing resource	2
the great work	2
will definitely return	2
be made more	2
make this an	2
how you have	2
way to load	2
innovator in residence	2
section was very	2
i was taken	2
would only play	2
you this is	2
site is really	2
make it easy	2
cool to have	2
a wonderful idea	2
have the remix	2
you can make	2
to choose from	2
great idea and	2
hear the full	2
fun and interesting	2
in terms of	2
will make this	2
sound browser is	2
i loved it	2
into the remix	2
in the beat	2
you very much	2
you click a	2
to make music	2
forward to seeing	2
use a lot	2
the individual sounds	2
on a mobile	2
a tool that	2
to control the	2
at this time	2
drum machines available	2
to scrub through	2
the full source	2
you can create	2
but i really	2
from the large	2
that is a	2
with my students	2
use a little	2
following the progress	2
would be the	2
thank you i	2
the collection of	2
exploring it further	2
samples for me	2
that i thought	2
access to such	2
the sounds i	2
have to click	2
a while to	2
cool idea though	2
our shared history	2
more like a	2
this is dope	2
mobile experience was	2
more time on	2
a sample i	2
that i had	2
to check out	2
to have an	2
options on the	2
of the song	2
this was a	2
a little difficult	2
multiple samples into	2
addition to the	2
playing with the	2
to select a	2
which is very	2
to add to	2
this and i	2
what a fantastic	2
is pretty amazing	2
in the sequencer	2
do not have	2
and i couldnt	2
i have more	2
make the user	2
able to explore	2
history of the	2
but if it	2
the full launch	2
if it was	2
very cool tool	2
scroll the page	2
to utilize it	2
for new sounds	2
but the execution	2
to find something	2
idea and a	2
great if it	2
but i was	2
make music and	2
on the screen	2
i like to	2
at your fingertips	2
am working on	2
the addition of	2
to use on	2
that makes it	2
downloaded as wavs	2
when on the	2
would also like	2
samples as opposed	2
people to use	2
interface is a	2
i believe it	2
to choose the	2
you have done	2
up or down	2
use more than	2
that i am	2
create their own	2
it to play	2
you get to	2
sounds and put	2
citizen dj today	2
way to navigate	2
really fun and	2
into the different	2
to be very	2
no idea what	2
and good luck	2
and fun to	2
like to see	2
how to go	2
and if you	2
would be really	2
different set of	2
a bit slow	2
way of finding	2
on the drum	2
combine different sounds	2
if there is	2
think the current	2
find a sound	2
of the full	2
from the explore	2
bring back the	2
with the site	2
to a library	2
be cool if	2
of this tool	2
the beat mixer	2
figured out how	2
in my daw	2
could be extended	2
this idea is	2
tool and i	2
which would be	2
off the bat	2
to search by	2
thanks to everyone	2
it but i	2
impossible to find	2
i like what	2
so i just	2
you move the	2
sounds to sample	2
dragging to explore	2
to the public	2
to hear longer	2
the middle of	2
a fantastic resource	2
of samples that	2
problem for me	2
a great feature	2
of the tool	2
awareness of the	2
for scrolling through	2
fun to use	2
to find samples	2
a bit confusing	2
such a great	2
will try again	2
myself using this	2
idea of what	2
in some other	2
way to hear	2
could use a	2
check it out	2
is an interesting	2
a bunch of	2
i figured it	2
i could imagine	2
is such a	2
when looking at	2
that shows the	2
i can use	2
of music sampling	2
this project is	2
on each sample	2
but i would	2
this is absolutely	2
possible to just	2
the mouse to	2
of this website	2
more of a	2
what i created	2
have taken to	2
with the samples	2
is not as	2
meant to be	2
other samples in	2
and using it	2
using this site	2
and wanted to	2
so many sounds	2
this is pretty	2
did not seem	2
link to some	2
play with and	2
thank you this	2
excited to play	2
would be ideal	2
in the way	2
sound i like	2
based on the	2
in the browse	2
tool is great	2
for the future	2
the screen so	2
looking for a	2
this is how	2
of the clip	2
need to explore	2
use and intuitive	2
myself wanting to	2
for royalty free	2
download the samples	2
be using this	2
that limit is	2
enjoyed using the	2
i love what	2
of sound and	2
love to help	2
the list of	2
can create something	2
very easy to	2
maybe a search	2
listen to a	2
whether i can	2
i think you	2
were a way	2
it out and	2
interest in the	2
is that the	2
what i thought	2
the same time	2
as well and	2
you are only	2
thanks so much	2
would not play	2
to drag around	2
to work on	2
interesting way to	2
is confusing to	2
to see more	2
aspect of this	2
the samples in	2
a search box	2
have the option	2
is a good	2
sure i will	2
browser is an	2
i am working	2
different tracks but	2
as soon as	2
it to the	2
some kind of	2
not sure how	2
make it more	2
was asked to	2
am a producer	2
your experience with	2
of congress has	2
which i have	2
but they were	2
sample in the	2
i like that	2
is a huge	2
i know i	2
i just need	2
use the remix	2
as it is	2
select a sample	2
in on the	2
find a sample	2
you are doing	2
and look forward	2
interested in that	2
with this tool	2
is very nice	2
the full site	2
about finding the	2
clicking and dragging	2
would be interesting	2
please keep working	2
have to put	2
to open the	2
a treasure trove	2
this would be	2
a single remix	2
and would be	2
really cool and	2
the wav files	2
way to find	2
i thought the	2
through all the	2
and i believe	2
an amazing way	2
be happy to	2
there are a	2
looking for new	2
thanks for creating	2
parts of the	2
of the remix	2
much for creating	2
been a huge	2
i was not	2
way to sort	2
like the visual	2
be possible to	2
search for a	2
an educational tool	2
the record function	2
figured it out	2
i make music	2
instead of just	2
as a dj	2
inspire a lot	2
it for my	2
a tool to	2
tool that i	2
access to this	2
to following the	2
clips from multiple	2
would be to	2
explore it and	2
cursor around to	2
to drag the	2
the mouse button	2
have more control	2
making a beat	2
i would just	2
and it got	2
and it would	2
to the mix	2
how the samples	2
have no idea	2
a wealth of	2
i expected to	2
the selected sample	2
love to use	2
great tool that	2
and forth between	2
load it into	2
citizen dj is	2
to find specific	2
i can see	2
to find it	2
i wish i	2
in this project	2
can reach me	2
on the clips	2
it is selected	2
keep doing this	2
it is fun	2
it only plays	2
to access the	2
where you select	2
sounds on the	2
may not be	2
forward to see	2
one issue i	2
know about it	2
than one sample	2
redacted this is	2
to look at	2
to click and	2
look of the	2
to press a	2
going to give	2
it is an	2
a dj and	2
make hip hop	2
side of the	2
using the tool	2
to make a	2
you are in	2
a college professor	2
treasure trove of	2
they can create	2
on a computer	2
i wish there	2
of what the	2
make this a	2
browsing page with	2
nice to have	2
control over the	2
the buttons at	2
how i would	2
combine samples from	2
the explore view	2
within a daw	2
as well as	2
of the source	2
to download samples	2
it is not	2
they were all	2
around with it	2
looking for specific	2
coming back to	2
should be able	2
love the interface	2
to the mixer	2
think my husband	2
when you click	2
samples to use	2
with it more	2
to move around	2
is there a	2
hear only the	2
more control over	2
when it comes	2
information at the	2
was not clear	2
is an extremely	2
you for all	2
soon as i	2
love a way	2
also be an	2
maybe have a	2
valuable resource for	2
listening to the	2
the remix app	2
be valuable to	2
some of those	2
the site more	2
way to build	2
in a different	2
all the sounds	2
use it for	2
the samples with	2
it was unclear	2
it on a	2
idea what the	2
and sliced samples	2
my friends and	2
be played when	2
together with the	2
a whole new	2
of this site	2
and see if	2
to see this	2
try again on	2
i still have	2
reminds me of	2
there were a	2
recording output error	2
you need a	2
in a long	2
to exploring and	2
able to save	2
use longer samples	2
or if i	2
it is to	2
as much as	2
play the whole	2
it so far	2
to create their	2
the bottom and	2
layout of the	2
very well done	2
i did like	2
really looking forward	2
overall it was	2
i am going	2
drag around the	2
add a search	2
to a different	2
it would have	2
a very cool	2
at one point	2
with the remix	2
love this project	2
would be interested	2
need to adjust	2
wait for the	2
people looking for	2
this amazing resource	2
you could do	2
the most useful	2
likely be more	2
page with the	2
grid of sounds	2
in this way	2
remix feature is	2
using the record	2
free music archive	2
how to search	2
this as a	2
thank you to	2
access to a	2
share what i	2
be helpful to	2
and lots of	2
it into my	2
asked to do	2
and will definitely	2
could use it	2
source of inspiration	2
make sure to	2
option would be	2
into the sequencer	2
for use in	2
scrolling through all	2
it took me	2
you library of	2

i could find	2
hip hop producer	2

through the sounds	2
might be nice	2
way i can	2

navigate and i	2
to me as	2
the sounds available	2
a big fan	2
lot of work	2
looking for more	2
beat as a	2
have any more	2
a little cumbersome	2
the explore screen	2
all your hard	2
as a tool	2
for the effort	2
easier to use	2
able to tell	2
it as a	2
lot of effort	2
would use the	2
start and end	2
and the sound	2
to develop and	2
from the site	2
i was using	2
be downloaded as	2
on an ipad	2
playing around with	2
ability to download	2
like how you	2
for the world	2
make your own	2
if that were	2
need to spend	2
that was not	2
but i could	2
producers like me	2
understand how to	2
was great to	2
to understand how	2
and what you	2
sounds i would	2
the entire source	2
to interact with	2
my email is	2
see if i	2
of potential and	2
the lack of	2
that i downloaded	2
very intuitive and	2
the different collections	2
cool to see	2
without clicking and	2
back and forth	2
looking for sounds	2
to create music	2
one thing that	2
you brian foo	2
it would not	2
know that the	2
be used in	2
cool to be	2
pii redacted i	2
be easier to	2
the free music	2
the beat as	2
down the mouse	2
i could download	2
step sequencer to	2
have a link	2
to use these	2
try it out	2
that let you	2
it was hard	2
to be used	2
the browse function	2
that it is	2
would be good	2
bit clunky and	2
in the beginning	2
outside of the	2
i came here	2
not in the	2
lot of potential	2
people i know	2
all the files	2
why am i	2
thanks for your	2
familiar with the	2
to hear the	2
to find multiple	2
when trying to	2
few things i	2
short by default	2
for my music	2
little difficult to	2
happy to see	2
maybe you could	2
the audio files	2
thank you very	2
and listen to	2
to have some	2
would be more	2
that i will	2
using this resource	2
on my end	2
experience with citizen	2
but it is	2
the more information	2
from the main	2
on this project	2
in my head	2
overall this is	2
the samples are	2
know if it	2
colors in the	2
not find a	2
download the beat	2
to combine multiple	2
way to have	2
browse the sounds	2
without having to	2
launched the study	2
more information tab	2
but it could	2
to have all	2
to see where	2
not seem to	2
the use of	2
dj and a	2
music that i	2
i get that	2
not be able	2
to the site	2
but i have	2
a drum machine	2
is mind blowing	2
sounds can be	2
was cool but	2
found it a	2
i was just	2
the site to	2
that would make	2
i understand that	2
the amount of	2
i know it	2
when using the	2
is fantastic and	2
how to save	2
so that when	2
i did it	2
really enjoyed the	2
so you can	2
i can preview	2
not only for	2
clear to me	2
this this is	2
tiny snippets of	2
do think the	2
link to the	2
and if i	2
like to use	2
there should also	2
drum sounds and	2
amazing thank you	2
the data visualization	2
function on the	2
snippets of a	2
use it as	2
so i could	2
allow you to	2
to be in	2
much for making	2
really cool idea	2
i absolutely love	2
the united states	2
what i could	2
this project to	2
think that would	2
big fan of	2
think that the	2
will definitely be	2
but i did	2
of samples and	2
how to browse	2
is really cool	2
going to be	2
here is amazing	2
for people looking	2
samples in one	2
new sounds and	2
buttons next to	2
on my ipad	2
you have any	2
an incredible idea	2
the sounds on	2
it looks like	2
the future of	2
not let this	2
to the browse	2
had to open	2
cool project and	2
the context of	2
player at the	2
that when you	2
even in this	2
put them into	2
no no nice	2
are supposed to	2
i had a	2
incredibly excited to	2
for working on	2
some other software	2
looks like the	2
a hobbyist musician	2
able to make	2
as a quick	2
intensity content is	2
able to see	2
if i had	2
into the beat	2
a fantastic project	2
search for sounds	2
for a specific	2
by clicking on	2
to combine different	2
very much for	2
and i have	2
this was fun	2
the sound you	2
what to expect	2
a fantastic idea	2
not intuitive at	2
the colors in	2
your work on	2
search function would	2
can see it	2
ui could use	2
so happy that	2
difficult to explore	2
email is redacted	2
the hard work	2
time on the	2
the raw files	2
change the time	2
for music i	2
way you can	2
about your experience	2
did like the	2
with a lot	2
out of beta	2
loved the visual	2
citizen dj i	2
for someone who	2
control the length	2
a minor bug	2
think you have	2
context of a	2
the way you	2
i was able	2
be very helpful	2
had a lot	2
learn how to	2
the ui ux	2
idea and i	2
the interface to	2
but i wonder	2
continue to explore	2
focus on the	2
this makes it	2
site is easy	2
the top of	2
just need a	2
when i tried	2
download the sample	2
making it available	2
fun to play	2
this is the	2
that easy to	2
adjust the size	2
integrate multiple samples	2
an amazing idea	2
to hear only	2
of the audio	2
and it is	2
how to select	2
where the samples	2
way to search	2
sample to remix	2
to share about	2
makes it easy	2
and put them	2
i was also	2
a wider audience	2
able to complete	2
brilliant way to	2
it was the	2
should be used	2
i missed it	2
if it were	2
hard to navigate	2
the rest of	2
should be an	2
any more feedback	2
it seemed a	2
so that you	2
on the explore	2
sample with a	2
on the grid	2
thank you again	2

to see that	2
them to use	2
the sample browsing	2
