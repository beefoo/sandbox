Note
Cataloged from container and accompanying paperwork.

We're treating this as clips used for a talk Schwartz gave on the Taxi material, but not a recording of the entire presentation. There are also differences between the tracks listed on the card accompanying the tape and the tracks listed on several xeroxed lists found in the tape box. The clips may not include the first clip, she's leaving home, or the last clip on modern art. If you could listen for this information, that would be appreciated. Thanks! Sheryl Fowler 17 April 2008.

Technical note (Matt):
This tape has paper leader at the head and paper and blank tape leader at the tail. This tape has splices.

Engineer notes (Brad):
