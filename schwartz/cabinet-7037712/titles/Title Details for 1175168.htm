Content note:
"The tape recorder is a good device to learn people's attitudes. Here is a phonomontage of people's attitudes about riding the subway. Most of the comments deal with the theme of fear and crime on the subway. In 1959, people were less concerned with crime on the subway. The attitudes of the same people speaking about the subway in 1959 and 1965 are compared"--Accompanying collection documentation.
