[Audio engineer should verify, if possible, that Tony Schwartz recorded the MLK speech given at the SEIU Local 1199 Salute to Freedom celebration, New York City, March 10, 1968. Audio of this speech, given three weeks before King's assassination, is available on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBodqhUGoq0&feature=channel_page) for comparison. M. Maguire 2/23/2009]

"I've been to the mountaintop" speech given in Memphis, April 3, 1968, the day before King's death.

Location of Coretta Scott King's speech (track 4) not provided. May have been April 27 or 28 speech, Central Park, New York (http://www.election411.org/article/id/3528126/coretta-scott-king-speech-three-weeks-after-martins-assassination).

-added information to the general/summary. 
-multiple tape speeds. transferred each section at it's appropriate rate and rendered file. 
the introduction and the first cut are 15 ips, next segment is 7.5 ips then switches to 3.75 ips for the remainder of the reel
-to adress above question from cataloger. I compared audio to that on youtube, and it is indeed the same, but I'm still not sure Tony recorded it. He doesn't mention it in the introduction, except that he came across some of these recordings while working on a record called A Tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King.  

in general/summary for content notes, i did not remove the 
existing duration notes, indicated by (), but added additionally 
time/location indicated by [].
