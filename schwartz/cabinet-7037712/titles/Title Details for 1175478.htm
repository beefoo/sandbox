Preservation engineer notes (Brad) for RXF 4207:

Technical notes:
Full track mono tape with splices on 7" reel.  Tape recorded at 7 1/2 ips.  Levels vary.
Tape was azimuth adjusted on an Otari MTR-12 using the full track head, output in cal in A1.8 with signal routed through Maselec MTC-2 master control with +4 dB gain to Prism ADA-8XR analog to digital converters to Pyramix DAW version 7.0.11 SP3 Build 12120 21.04.2011.
Hum.

Content notes:
"Writing and speaking in the communication field needs serious thought.  There is a need to understand the sense of sound.  Bob Landers speaks about sound.  He reads a few passages contrary to the meaning of the words.  There is meaning in the way a line is read.  Many times copy does not speak to the consumer; 'prepared meats'"--Accompanying collection documentation.
