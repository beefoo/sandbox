    The alternating current of Sandy Mason

Summary

"Styles of singing and presentation change in the course of time.  Singers used to walk in with just a guitar, now they bring their own unique electrical equipment.  From the Slate Restaurant we hear Sandy Mason talk about work and sing 'Those Were the Days' while playing her guitar.  She uses some electronic equipment" (00:00) --Accompanying collection documentation.
