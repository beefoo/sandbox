Subway and Lincoln

Summary

"Sounds from New York.  1. Sound story on the New York Subway System.  A train roars into the 59th St. station.  Tony tells about the subway system.  We hear the sound of turnstiles, running trains, and passengers commenting on the subway system.  They tell how much time they spend on the subway, how they feel about the subway, and what can be done to improve the subway.  2. Portrait of Lincoln: People tell what they think of the famous President.  They focus on his honesty, his kind nature, his log cabin, and his love of books.  An English man and a man from the Bronx talk about Abe."--Accompanying collection documentation.
